1. Abstract classes and Interfaces

2. Exception Handling

3. lambda expressions

4. Functional Interfaces


Abstract class: An abstract class is a class which has atleast one abstract method.
A method is abstract when its defintion is not available.

abstract class Ecommerce{
	public void selectGoods() {
		System.out.println("Selection of goods is through www.ecommerce.com");
	}
	
	public void payment() {
		System.out.println("Amount to be paid only through netbanking.");
	}
	
	abstract public void shipment();
}

Objects cannot be created directly with the abstract classes.
We have to inherit the abstract class into a child class and override the abstract method and 
create object for the child class.

Few points to remember
------------------------
1. We can write the constructors
2. Instance Variables can also be defined

Note: When we want to provide different implementations for the same method, then abstract classes
are used.


RBI says that 

1. accounts()

2. loans()

3. deposit()

Interface
---------
An interface is a java element which consists of all abstract methods.
We cannot create objects for interfaces directly

We need to implements the abstract methods into a child class and have to priovide
definitions to all the abstract methods.

To inherit the abstract methods, we use keyword "implements"
interfaces will be written usihg interface keyword

In interface all the methods are abstract only, no need to write explcitly the abstract keyword.
All the methods are public only, even though access specifier is not provided.

ie, by default all the methods in interfaces are public and abstract, so we can remove these while
writing the interfaces.

Few points to note:
-------------------
1. we cannot write the constructors in the intefaces
2. Instance variables cannot be defined.
3. But we can define a constant with final keyword.

Final: It is an access modifier, which can be applied to
	1. on variable  -- Then it becomes constant, so its value cannot be changed.
	2. on method  --- Then it cannot be overriden
	3. on class ---- That class not be inherited.


Basically interfaces are used to define the rules or templates or blueprints or skeleton

By using interfaces we can acheive multiple inheritance

interface inter1{
	public void test1();
	public void test2();
}

interface inter2{
	public void test3();
	public void test4();
}

class MultipleExample implements inter1, inter2{

}

class extends class   ----> valid
class extends class1,class2  ---> Invalid
class implements inteface  ----> valid
class extends interface -----> invalid
interface extends inteface ---> valid
interface extends interface1, interface2 ----> invalid
class extends class implements interface ----> valid
class extends class implements interface1,interface2 ---> valid


From java8 onwards
------------------

java2

4 --------

7 ------
8 -------Drastic change

--> focused on the optimization of the code
--> parallel and concurrent processing of the jobs
--> optiumum utilization of processors
default methods and static methods are introduced from java8 onwards
any number of default methods or static methods

default methods should be called only on the child classes
static methods should be called only on the interface 

Lambda Expressions
------------------

public void display(){
	System.out.println("Hello world");
}
if(cond)
	s1

else

	s2

Lambda expressions are annoymous functions, without any acces specifier, method name and return type.
lambda expressions has two parts, 
1.parameter list 
2. body or definition

parameter is sepearted with body by using arrow operator ->


public void display(){
	System.out.println("Hello world");
}


()->System.out.println("Hello world");

public void display(String name){
	System.out.println("Hello , "+name);
}

(name) ->System.out.println("Hello , "+name);

name->System.out.println("Hello, "+name);


public void display(String name, String city){
	System.out.println("Hello , "+name+" welcome to" +city);
}


(name,city)->System.out.println("Hello , "+name+" welcome to" +city);


public void display(String name, String city){
	System.out.println("Hello , "+name+" welcome to" +city);
	System.out.println("You state is also confimed");
}

(name,city)->{
	System.out.println("Hello , "+name+" welcome to" +city);
	System.out.println("You state is also confimed");
}

public int add(int a, int b){
	return a+b;
}

(a,b)->a+b;

public int add(int a, int b){
	int area = a*b;
	return area;
}

(a,b)->{
	int area = a*b;	
	return area;
}

Lambada expression are used to provide the implementations for the functional interfaces only
they cannot be used as is.

A fuctional interface is an interface with only one abstract method.


interface Maths{
	public void add(int a, int b);
}

java8 predefined functional interfaces
1. Predicate
2. Function
3. Consumer
4. Supplier

public interface Predicate<T>{
	public boolean test(T t);
}

public boolean test(int k) {
		if(k%2==0)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
}

Predicate<Integer> p1 = x->x%2==0
p1.test(50);

@FunctionalInterface
interface Predicate<T>{

	public boolean test(T t);
}



Function: It is a predefined functional interface which has only one method
called apply and it can any single value datatype as input and returns
andy datatype.


@FunctionalInterface
public interface Function<T,R>{
	public R apply(T t);
}


Exception Handling
-------------------
when you write any program errors may get at compile time or runtime
compile time errors are mostly  due to syntax issues
but runtime errors cannot be predicted.

The process of handling the runtime errors is called exception handling.


1. if I have written a program to read a file and display its content.
   in run time if that file is not available in the hard disk.
   if we dont have permissions to access the file

2. int a = b/d;


3. String str = "Hai";
	System.out.println(str.charAt(5));

The main objective of exception handling is not to terminate the program execution when the
exception is occured


try{


}
catch()
{

}
finally{

}
next statements

case 1: If exception not occured in try block
try ---> finally --> next steps

case 2: if exception occured in try block
try --> catch ---> finally --> next steps

case 3 : if exception occured and no corresponding catch block
try ---> finally --->abort the program

create a student class with name and marks 
create a funtion functional interface to accept the student object and based
on the marks inside the student class display its result as first or second
or third or fail.
