When ever we are using multiple catch blocks, always parent catch block must be the 
last one in the hierarchy.

Always use multiple try-catch blocks to handle the exception, ie., just keep that part of the
code which has error prones in the try catch.

All the direct sub classes of Exception are checked exceptions and all the direct decendants of
RuntimeException are unchecked exceptions.

All checked exceptions are to be handled explicitly by using try..catch blocks or by adding
throws statement in the method signature.

Unchecked exceptions doesnot have any check at the compilation time, but if runtime error occurs
it terminates the program if we dont have any exception handling mechanism.


throw ---> is used to explicitly throw the exception object even its corresponding scenario is not 
occured.

It explicitly transfer the control to the block, it is basically used to create the userdefined 
exceptions


Steps to be followed to write userdefined exception
----------------------------------------------------
1. create any userdefined class with userdefined exception name and extend the
   either Exception or RuntimeExcpetion class

2. Provide any description by using super keyword in the class.

3. Provide the condition to raise

4. Test the exception by raising the condition explicitly.

Multithreading
--------------
It is the process of simultensouly executing the parts of the same program.
The part which is currently executing is called Thread.
In java, threads can be created by using,

1. Thread class
2. Runnable interface


Methods in Thread class
-----------------------
1. public void start()  // this will start the thread to execute
2. public void run()  // this will contains the actual task of thread
3. public final void setName(String name)  Thread-0, Thread-1,
4. public final String getName()
5. public final void setPriority(int newPriority)    t.setPriority(9);
6. public final int getPriority()

7. public final void join()

8. public final void join(long millisec)
The current thread invokes this method on a second thread, causing the current thread to block
 until the second thread terminates or the specified number of milliseconds passes.

9. public final void setDaemon(boolean on)
t.setDeamon(true);
10. public final boolean isDaemon()

11. public final boolean isAlive()
12. public long getId()
13. public void interrupt()
14. public boolean isInterrupted()
15. public static void dumpStack()
16. public static void sleep(long millis)

17. public static void yield()
Causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and 
allow other threads to execute.

18. public static Thread currentThread()

Why we are calling start() instead of run()
-------------------------------------------
1. The start() method register the thread with Thread Scheduler.

2. It performs all other mandatory activities for a thread.

3. It invokes the run method.

4. Most importantly, it starts a new thread. 
   If we not use the start method and call the run method directly then no 
   new thread will be created and run method will be treated as a normal method.


Synchronization:
-----------------
It is the processs of securing the resources without any conflict.
Synchronization is a process of controlling mutual exclusive problem in multithreading environment. 
How to implement Synchronization:

Using synchronized method.
	a. Using non-static synchronized method.
	b. static synchronized method.
Using synchronized block.

Collection
----------
Collections is represenation of group of objects as a single element.

Collection framework is the collection / group of interfaces , algorithms and implementations to
represent the group of objects as a single element.


Collection framwork has set of interfaces and classes, Collection interface is base for all
these and it has List, Set and Queue  groups 

List
----
1. It is a collection of ordered elements ie elements are in linear fashion.
2. All the elements are organized in the order of insertion.
3.Elements can be accessed by using its index.
4. null values are allowed in the group.
5. duplicate values are also allowed.

Methods in collection
--------------------
add()
addAll()
contains()
containsAll()
delete()
retain()
retianAll()


Set
---
1. Set is a un ordered collection of elements
2. Insertion order is not maintained.
3. duplicates are not allowed
4. null values are allowed only once.

TreeSet: display elements in sorted order
